# Notes

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* I have used React, ES6 syntax and Fetch API.
* I did not used SASS or other CSS compiler because of the design simplicity.
* I am not familiar with building API's in Node.js, so I have used the API at http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
* I have used React v15 and React Router v3

# How to run

* NodeJS and NPM are required before testing this solution.
* Inside root folder, open a CLI and run 'npm install'
* After the install was finished, run 'npm start' and a local server will be opened.
